## Add a image as a texture

To add a image as a texture you can add `material="src:path-to-your-image"` in a primitive.
For example:

``` { .html .copy linenums="1"}
<a-sphere material="src:rocks.jpg" position="0 1.25 -5" radius="1.25" color="white"></a-sphere>
```
`rocks.jpg` is the name of the image placed at the root of the folder.

## Video texture
